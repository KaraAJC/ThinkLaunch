**Instructor** - Kara

**TAs** - Jerliyah, Ryan, Nithun, Justin, Oscar, Asha

## Session Goal:
To Review our MVP prototype, and apply testing strategies to iterate on our work

## Session Schedule:

### Welcome:
  - Speaker
    - Anthony

### Why We Test?
  Testing is meant two help answer the following questions:
  - What do I *expect* this product to do?
  - Does this product do what it's mean to do for *EVERYONE?*
  - What will stop this product from doing what I expect it to do? i.e. *How does one break the product*

#### Security Points:
  - HTTP vs HTTPS
  - SSL Certificates

### Intro to Test Strategies:
  - BDD
    User Stories => Acceptance Criteria
    Scenarios: *Given, When, Then*
  - Performance Testing

  *Activity*: Take Two of your user stories, create acceptance criteria and two scenarios

### Running Tests:
  - Chrome Dev Tools
  - Network Tests
  - Cross-Browser Tests
  - Accessibility Tests - [WebAIM](http://wave.webaim.org/)
  - Color-Blindness Tests - [Color Matrix checker](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/matrix/)
  
  *Activity*: Learn How to use Chrome Dev Tools to run tests
  
### Deployment:
  - Github Pages - Github lets users host User/Organization pages (username.github.io) AND project pages for each of your repositories (username.github.io/repository) for free if your project does not require a server to run. 
  - Other Deployment Options (that will host a running server for you):
    - [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
    - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/s/dm/optimization/server-side-test/free-tier/free_np/)
    - [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
    - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
    - [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)

## Homework:
  - [ ] Complete Acceptance criteria and 2 scenarios for each of your user stories
  - [ ] Make Changes based on tests you implement
  - [ ] Deploy your MVP on Github pages
    - Step ONE: Create a **NEW** repository named _YOUR USER NAME_.github.io (this will be your USER github page. you can feel free to set this up with a theme, and create markdown pages to use as a blog or a portfolio site for yourself! [use the instructions on the Github Pages Site](https://pages.github.com/) to get this step complete.
